## Description 
- In this assignment I created a timed quiz. When the user correctly answers, their score increases. Inversely, when answered inccorectly, the quiz timer decreases.
After the user is finshed with the quiz, they can then submit their initials and view the previous scores and who scored them(defined by initials).
